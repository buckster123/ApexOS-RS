# USB exo-workspace — a portable agent workspace on removable media

Plug a prepared USB stick into any ApexOS node and it becomes part of the agent's
workspace: APEX reads **and writes** it, it shows up in the Explorer (📁 Files), and
the desktop apps reach it — so a human carries their work between nodes (and, later,
hands off to the phone PWA). Slice 1 delivers the **plug → mount → use → eject** core.

## The idea (why it's simple under the hood)

Everything in ApexOS confines file access to **`AGENTD_WORKSPACE`** (`/var/lib/agentd/
workspace`): the Explorer (`/api/workspace/list` → `resolve_workspace_path`), the
agent's FS tools (`tools.rs::confine()`), and the desktop apps. So if a stick mounts
**under** the workspace at `…/workspace/media/<label>`, it's automatically reachable
everywhere with **zero confine/gateway/security changes** — it just appears as a
`media/` folder. That's the whole trick.

## The convention (the "marker")

A stick is an ApexOS **exo-workspace** when:
- its **filesystem LABEL** is `APEX-<name>` — udev reads this *without* mounting, so
  it's the claim discriminator (no probe-mount race); and
- it carries an **`apexos-workspace.toml`** marker at its root + the standard layout
  (`projects/ data/ notes/`).

**exFAT is recommended** — the owner uid is set at mount time (so the stick is
portable across nodes whatever each node's `agentd` uid is) and it's Mac/Windows/
Android-friendly (the future phone-handoff leg). Prepare a stick with
`apexos-workspace-init <mountpoint> [name]` (writes the marker + layout, and prints
the relabel command, since relabelling needs the unmounted device).

## Marker-gated own-mount (the claim)

Only `APEX-*` sticks are claimed — every other USB is left to the desktop's file
manager (GNOME/udisks) or simply ignored on a kiosk, so this is safe on a
daily-driver laptop. **Why own-mount instead of adopting the DE's mount:** `agentd`
runs as the non-root `agentd` user; a DE mounts sticks as *you* with restrictive
perms, so the agent couldn't write them. So we mount with `uid=agentd` ourselves.

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `deploy/udev/99-apexos-usb.rules` | On an `APEX-*` block dev: `UDISKS_IGNORE=1` (DE defers) + start the mount service on `add`, run the umount helper on `remove`. |
| `deploy/systemd/apexos-usb-mount@.service` | Oneshot (root) — `ExecStart`/`ExecStop` call the helpers, keyed on the kernel dev name. |
| `deploy/usb/usb-mount` | Own-mount at `<workspace>/media/<label>` with `noexec,nosuid,nodev` + `uid=agentd,gid=agentd` (FAT/exFAT) or mount+chown (other). Hard-confines the mountpoint to `media/`; idempotent; records dev→mountpoint in `/run/apexos-usb/`. |
| `deploy/usb/usb-umount` | Unmount by `<dev>` (udev remove, via the `/run` state) or `--label APEX-…` (eject). Hard-confines + validates the label before touching anything. |
| `deploy/sudoers.d/apexos-usb` | Lets the non-root `agentd` user run **only** `usb-umount` as root (for UI/agent eject). |

`install.sh` installs all of the above (helpers → `/usr/local/lib/apexos/`,
`apexos-workspace-init` → `/usr/local/bin`), validates the sudoers with `visudo -c`,
makes `<workspace>/media`, and reloads udev. Runs on every node (the marker-gate
keeps it safe everywhere).

## Eject — privilege separation, NOT sudo

agentd runs as the non-root `agentd` user with **`NoNewPrivileges=true`** (systemd
hardening), and that flag makes the kernel **block setuid `sudo` entirely** — so a
sudoers drop-in can *never* let agentd umount (this is why the first eject attempt
failed in the field). The fix is privilege separation, so agentd never escalates at all:

1. `POST /api/media/eject {label}` (gateway) — or the agent `eject_media` tool — validates
   the label (`valid_exo_label`: `APEX-*`, sane chars, no `..`), confirms it's mounted, and
   **drops an empty `APEX-<label>` request file** into the agentd-owned eject dir
   (`AGENTD_USB_EJECT_DIR`, default `/var/lib/agentd/usb-eject` — under `ReadWritePaths`, so
   the non-root daemon can write it).
2. A **path unit** `apexos-usb-eject.path` (root) watches that dir and fires
   `apexos-usb-eject.service` (root oneshot), whose `usb-eject-drain` removes each request
   and runs `usb-umount --label` **as root** — the label re-validated by the drain and a
   third time by `usb-umount`, which hard-confines the target to `<workspace>/media/`.
3. The requester **polls `/proc/mounts`** (≤8s): success when the mountpoint disappears;
   otherwise a clear "still mounted — check `journalctl -u apexos-usb-eject`".

So the only thing agentd ever does is write a file in a directory it owns; the umount
happens entirely in a root service it can't influence beyond the (thrice-validated) label.
The old `deploy/sudoers.d/apexos-usb` is removed (it was inert under `NoNewPrivileges`).
Surfaced in the Explorer as a **⏏** affordance on each `media/*` stick row (ui-slint); on
success it refreshes the view.

## File operations (the Explorer is a real file manager)

Because an `APEX-*` stick is **GNOME-ignored by design** (the udev `UDISKS_IGNORE`),
the **Explorer (📁 Files) is the on-ApexOS path for moving work on and off the stick**
— so it carries the full verb set, not just read+navigate+preview:

| Verb | Endpoint (gated, confined) | Notes |
|------|----------------------------|-------|
| New folder | `POST /api/workspace/mkdir {path}` | single level under an existing dir |
| Rename | `POST /api/workspace/rename {path, name}` | `name` is one safe component (no `/`, `..`) |
| Delete | `POST /api/workspace/delete {path}` | file or recursive dir; refuses the workspace root |
| Move | `POST /api/workspace/move {src, dest}` | `dest` = target **dir** (keeps basename); cross-device (workspace ⇄ stick) falls back to copy+remove (EXDEV) |
| Copy | `POST /api/workspace/copy {src, dest}` | recursive for a folder |

All five resolve through the **same `resolve_workspace_path` / `resolve_workspace_write_path`**
confinement the read endpoints + agent FS tools use — both ends of a move/copy are
workspace-confined, names are validated (`safe_component`, unit-tested), `..`/absolute
escapes and name collisions are rejected, and a mounted stick's *mountpoint* can't be
deleted (it's busy — eject first). The verbs are UI-only (the agent already has
`write_file`/`delete_path`); no new agent tool or policy rule.

**UI (ui-slint `explorer_view.slint`):** an action row (**+ Folder**, **Paste**) + a
per-row **⋮** menu (Rename / Cut / Copy / Delete). Cut/Copy load a view-local
clipboard; **Paste** drops it into the folder in view (cut → move, copy → copy). New
folder + rename use a name-prompt overlay; delete uses a confirm overlay. A
drive→workspace move is just Cut on a `media/<label>/…` row → navigate → Paste.

## The agent knows the stick is there, and can eject it itself

Two pieces close the loop so APEX handles the stick conversationally ("want me to
eject it now that I've saved the report?"):

- **Embodiment hint** — `build_embodiment` (agentd) adds a line listing the sticks
  mounted under `media/` when any are present: it reads `/proc/mounts` (authoritative —
  a leftover empty mountpoint after eject doesn't show) via the pure, unit-tested
  `parse_exo_sticks`. The line is **byte-stable** when nothing changes, so it's safe in
  the cache-sensitive embodiment block — it only mutates on a real plug/eject (exactly
  when the cache *should* refresh). So the agent wakes already knowing the stick exists,
  its label, and that it's read+write like any workspace folder.
- **`eject_media{label}` tool** (apexos-tools, policy **`allow`**) — the agent's own
  safe-eject: validates the label (`valid_exo_label`, mirrors the gateway + helper) and
  goes through the **same** request-file → root-drain path as the UI ⏏ (see *Eject* above;
  agentd can't sudo under `NoNewPrivileges`). Non-destructive (flush + unmount;
  re-pluggable), confined to `APEX-*` sticks. `allow` because the conversational "want me
  to eject it?" *is* the confirmation — a second
  approval card would be clunky. **Already-deployed nodes need `eject_media = "allow"`
  in their live `/etc/agentd/policy.toml`** (config seeds fresh nodes only) — else it
  gates as `unknown → ask`.

## Why the systemd sandbox isn't a problem here

agentd runs under `ProtectSystem=strict` but with **`PrivateMounts=no`** and the host
root mount is **`shared`**, so a mount made on the host under `/var/lib/agentd`
propagates into agentd's namespace — the agent sees the stick with no extra systemd
config. (Verified on apex-3.) `noexec,nosuid,nodev` blanket-protects against an
untrusted FS image; deeper untrusted-filesystem hardening is a post-mk1 item.

## Verify

- **Dev box (no real stick)**: `valid_exo_label` unit test (gateway); the bash helpers
  syntax-check + their validation/confinement paths run (bad label rejected, not-mounted
  no-op); `POST /api/media/eject` rejects bad labels and attempts the helper for good
  ones (gated). A full loopback test: `truncate -s 64M img && mkfs.exfat -L APEX-test img
  && losetup …` then run `usb-mount` (needs root).
- **Field-test (real exFAT stick)**: `apexos-workspace-init` + relabel `APEX-<name>` →
  plug it → it mounts at `workspace/media/APEX-<name>`, shows in Explorer, APEX can
  `read_file`/`write_file` under it, ⏏ unmounts cleanly; a *normal* USB still goes to
  GNOME (untouched). This is the one hardware-gated leg.

## Deferred (follow-on slices)

Phone-handoff (the PWA workspace file-browser leg), a **plug *notification*** into the
root session (detect the udev `add` → inject a `UserPrompt` so APEX greets a freshly
plugged stick the way it does a mesh node going dark), and `apexos-workspace-init` as a
one-tap Explorer action. *(Done: the Explorer file verbs, the `eject_media` agent tool,
and the embodiment "stick mounted" hint.)*
